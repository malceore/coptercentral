Created as part of a final project for my advanced databases course. We had one week to make a full e-commerce store front and populate an imaginary database. My two teammates were both business majors with no programming experience and relying on this course for them to just barely pass. I quickly set them to work using PHPMyAdmin to research and inject data for our Quadcopter and drone imaginary store front. I quickly sprung to action and pulled an all nighter to relearn PHP, generate the queries we needed and make a decent looking store front.

This is just meant to be a personal badge of honor for myself and not for others use really. If you find the source useful great!
