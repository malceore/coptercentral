  So use this functionality you simply add:

  	<div id="date"></div>
	
  To your anywhere in your webpage and this 
    script will make it whatever the variable 
	date is equal to automatically.
	
  To alter the date simple edit the below 
    variable date. Example:
	
	var date = "October 31st, 2020";

  The syntax is very important so make sure 
    to only edit what is inbetween the quotes.
	And don't stress out if it breaks, email 
	me at malceore@gmail.com.

var date = 'August 6th 2016';

window.onload = function(){
	console.log(date);
	document.getElementById("date").innerHTML = ""+date;
	carousel.next();
	setInterval(function(){
		carousel.next();
	}, 4500);
}


/*
  Lets talk about the Carousel function. To edit
    The quotes is more complex than just the 
	date. Javascript has something called an 
	array which is like a library of books. All
	the books have a number in a sorted order.
	
	Example: 
		var books = [
			"Moby dick",
			"Hatchet",
			"Hunger Games"
		];
		
  If you wanted to add or remove books you must 
	be careful to make sure the last book doesn't
	have a comma. Just like in speech you say:
	'1, 2, 3 ' with no comma after three. You can
	have as many or as few quotes as you want.
	
  So lets add a book called "Storm of Steel" to 
    books:
  
    Example:
		var books = [
			"Moby dick",
			"Hatchet",
			"Hunger Games",
			"Storm of Steel"
		];

		"'I am swimming this year because I CAN! A year ago I recieved a cancer diagnosis. This year I am cancer free!'",
